            <description>
                <p>Bugsy is a Staff Pick! Meet Bugsy! This adorably fluffy orange tabby is looking
                    for the loving home he so deserves. Bugsy was rescued from a hoarding situation
                    and was in need of medical care when he arrived. Bugsy had an old injury to one
                    of his eyes, and that eye needed to be removed. He is now on the mend and
                    healing well, and will adjust to life with just one eye without any issues.
                    Bugsy is understandably feeling a little shy in the busy shelter, but don't pass
                    him by! He is a super sweet and gentle kitty, whose personality will start to
                    blossom once he feels safe. With love and patience, we think this guy could be
                    compatible with gentle older children that can give him space while he adjusts
                    to his new home. Bugsy is positive for feline immunodeficiency virus - an easy
                    illness to manage (though he should be the only cat in the home, or live with
                    other FIV positive cats). We are not sure if Bugsy has lived with dogs before,
                    so slow and gradual introductions are recommended. Come in and meet Bugsy
                    today!</p>

            <description>
                <p> Cupid is a playful kitten that is ready to find his forever home! He is a very
                    curious and active kitten that loves playing with feather toys and chasing
                    anything that makes a crinkling sound. He definitely needs another kitten buddy
                    at home! All kittens are active and playful and looking for homes that can
                    provide them with daily playtime and lots of interaction - it is important for
                    kittens to get handled regularly so they get used to being pet and touched. They
                    also need to be taught that hands are not toys and skin is not for biting. Due
                    to their social needs and energy levels, Homeward Pet advises that kittens be
                    adopted in pairs or into homes with another young cat. Kittens are fragile and
                    require careful handling, so we recommend that families with children under 5
                    years of age do not adopt young kittens (under 4 months). Come down and meet
                    this gregarious little kitty today!</p>

            <description>
                <p>Sweet Joe is looking for a mellow home to call his own. He came to Homeward when
                    his family was no longer able to care for him. Joe has lived with cats before
                    and did not enjoy them, he is now looking for a cat free home. He has also lived
                    with a very energetic dog before, he did not enjoy that energy level but may be
                    successful living with another very mellow dog that is respectful of his space.
                    Joe prefers a calm environment and would be overwhelmed around younger kids. He
                    will likely do best in a home with older kids and teens that can participate in
                    his care. Come meet Joe today!</p>

                <p>Are you looking to add 5 pounds of sweetness to your life? Kenya might be the
                    right kitty for you! Kenya, like most young cats, is high energy, so she would
                    do best in a home that can give her lots of play time and help teach her proper
                    cat manners. Kenya came to us with limited history so we don't know if she's
                    lived with other cats or dogs before. Any introductions to new animal friends
                    should be done slowly. Kenya would likely do best with kids that are slightly
                    older, and that would be able to handle her gently.</p>

                <p>Are you looking to add a handsome purr bucket to your household? Look no further
                    than Kotten! Kotton is a social and active 7 month old adolescent. He would
                    thrive best in a home where the people are able to give multiple daily playtimes
                    and give him time to be the social butterfly that he is. Kotton came to us with
                    limited history so we don't know if he's lived with other cats or dogs before.
                    Any introductions to new four legged friends should be done slowly. Kotton would
                    likely do okay with slightly older kids that are able to handle him gently.</p>

                    adorable purrsonality. She loves to cuddle, but also has a playful side and
                    enjoys toys and climbing cat trees. Watching birds out the window is also high
                    on her list! Pixie can be shy, so she's looking for a home with older kids that
                    can let her settle in at her own pace. She lived with another cat before that
                    picked on her, so she's hoping that any future furry friends are mellow and give
                    her her own space. We don't know if she's met dogs before. Come meet this lovely
                    gal today!</p>
